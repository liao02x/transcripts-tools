00:00:00 Sam (openai.com): Hey there Staya.
00:00:02 Satya (microsoft.com): Hi Sam, how are you?
00:00:05 Sam (openai.com): I'm doing good. Do you think you can give us 10000 more GPUs?
00:00:06 Satya (microsoft.com): I'm sorry Sam we can't do 10000, how about 5000?
00:00:10 Sam (openai.com): Hmm, 5000 is definitely a step down from what we need, Satya. We're pushing the limits here with our models, and 10,000 would really help us scale faster. Is there any flexibility on your end to push that number up?
00:00:20 Satya (microsoft.com): I understand the urgency, Sam. We're committed to supporting your growth, but we also have to balance our resources across other projects. 10,000 is a big ask. What if we provide 5000 now and reassess in the next quarter?
00:00:35 Sam (openai.com): I see where you're coming from. The thing is, our roadmap is pretty aggressive. If we can secure more GPUs now, it sets us up for a smoother rollout of our next-gen models. How about we meet halfway at 7,500? That gives us a bit more breathing room, and it’s still under your initial request.
00:00:50 Satya (microsoft.com): 7,500 is a more manageable number, but it’s still a significant increase. Let me take this back to my team and see what we can do. Can you give me a day to get back to you on this?
00:01:00 Sam (openai.com): Absolutely, Satya. I appreciate you considering it. We’ll be standing by. If there's anything else we can do to make this work, let us know.
00:01:10 Satya (microsoft.com): Will do, Sam. Let’s aim to find a solution that works for both of us. Talk to you soon.
00:01:15 Sam (openai.com): Sounds good. Thanks, Satya.
