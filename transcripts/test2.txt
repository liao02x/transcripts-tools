00:00:00 Alice (NeuralNet.ai): Hi John,
00:00:02 John (NvidiaCorp): Hello Alice, how can I assist you today?
00:00:05 Alice (NeuralNet.ai): We're really excited about our next project and we believe an additional 15,000 GPUs could help accelerate its completion. Would that be possible?
00:00:06 John (NvidiaCorp): That's quite a significant request, Alice. I believe we can start with 7,500 GPUs to Kickstart your project and then reassess based on performance.
00:00:12 Alice (NeuralNet.ai): We appreciate that, John, but our simulations show that the optimal number would be around 12,000 GPUs to keep up with our planned parallel processing. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between?
00:00:25 John (NvidiaCorp): I understand your requirement, Alice. We'd certainly like to support you as much as possible. Given the current availability, how about we start with 9,000 GPUs and revisit this conversation in three months? That way, we can ensure consistency across our ongoing projects.
00:00:42 Alice (NeuralNet.ai): I appreciate your flexibility, John. Let's agree on that and if needed, we can discuss an adjustment after the quarter. Can you confirm this number for me?
00:01:00 John (NvidiaCorp): Yes, Alice, consider it confirmed. We'll set aside 9,000 GPUs dedicated to your project starting next week. Looking forward to a successful collaboration.
00:01:10 Alice (NeuralNet.ai): Thank you, John. That's a great start. Let's keep in touch about this, and please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities to optimize the setup further down the line.
00:01:25 John (NvidiaCorp): Absolutely, Alice. We're here to ensure your project's success. Have a fantastic week ahead!
00:01:30 Alice (NeuralNet.ai): Thank you, John. You too!
