00:00:00 Alice (neuralink.com): Hi John, this is Alice from Neuralink.
00:00:02 John (nvidia.com): Hello Alice, how can I assist you today?
00:00:05 Alice (neuralink.com): Thanks for taking my call, John. We're really pushing the boundaries with our neural interface technology and we could use some additional GPU power.
00:00:08 John (nvidia.com): Of course, Alice. What are you hoping to achieve?
00:00:10 Alice (neuralink.com): We've been discussing increasing our current allocation of 3000 GPUs to at least 6000 to expedite our simulations and testing.
00:00:15 John (nvidia.com): I see. However, 6000 is quite an increment from your current allotment. Let's consider stepping up to around 4500 initially. If you need more down the line, we can certainly revisit that number.
00:00:25 Alice (neuralink.com): I understand, but given our ambitious roadmap, having those extra GPUs would make a significant difference in accelerating our development timelines. Perhaps there's some flexibility to start with 5000?
00:00:35 John (nvidia.com): Let me consult with my team on this. We're keen to support your work at Neuralink, but we must also ensure fairness and balance across all our partners.
00:00:40 Alice (neuralink.com): Absolutely, I appreciate that. I'll be here if you need any more information before making a decision.
00:00:45 John (nvidia.com): Alright, thank you for your patience, Alice. I'll get back to you within the next 24 hours on this.
00:00:50 Alice (neuralink.com): Sounds good, John. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
00:00:55 John (nvidia.com): Likewise. Have a great day.
